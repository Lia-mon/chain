# What is this  
A tool to visualize and check chains for the FFBE mobile game

# Usage
It is a browser based app, you can try a live version [here](https://lia-mon.github.io/chain/)

# Building
I used svelte/sveltekit to build this app, nothing particularly special.

If you want to build it yourself 

```
npm install
npm run build
```
I am using the static adapter to generate a static site with added the PWA requirments to try it out.

The build will be in the `build` folder ta-dah.
